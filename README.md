# 1.👩‍⚕ API covid

🕵"API covid" is a app that allows you to obtain live data on the total number of deceased and infected with COVID 19 in the world. An external API is used that provides us with this information.

# 2. Realization of the Project
## 2.1 Design 📱

### 2.1.1 Low Fidelity Prototyping: 📝

When defining what content would go on the web page, a rough prototype of the distribution was made, with pencil and paper.

### 2.1.2 Wireframe: 🙋🏼
Therefore, in this phase we seek to make a more detailed virtual distribution scheme in Figma.

### 2.1.2 High Fidelity Prototyping: 💁🏼
After having the Wireframe, the web design is made based on styles, color palette, among other resources.

## 2.2 Result of the project: 📱
